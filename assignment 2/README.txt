I will mak it up with the business model of the company I worked for under a different name.
The business_website_design file has the rough outline for what Id like to make it look like
the different blocks will link to separate pages that will give more detailed information.

I mainly want the most important details about the business to be available on the first page with some
eye catching "block hyperlinks" to make it easy to navigate around to the more detailed information.  In
In this design clutter is the enemy, especially on the welcome page.
