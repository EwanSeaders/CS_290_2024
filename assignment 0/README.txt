1.  web MD-  It is a very professional looking site however I dont like that there is so much space used up 
for articles and how they are portrted almost as adds.  there is a lot to look at but not a lot of information
immediately presented to you.  otherwise it is well developed and loads fast

2.  Wikepedia- I like that wikepedia is so dense with information and is relatively easy to navigate.  The
layouts of the pages follow a very consistent pattern.  I lik that there is always an intro that gives you an
idea of what the subject is.  The sheer amount of information  that it portrays is beyond useful.  it does have
the feel of a bit older web platform however.

3.  Amazon- Over the years amazon has gotten much more useable.  It is pretty easy to make a search and have
good results from the search.  one thing that annoys me is that it is not easier to access your order history
or view your cart (especially on the app).  it seems to me like the cart should be its own button in the menu.
granted its still only a couple clicks but I never find myself using anything other than the package tracking or
returns under the my orders tab.

4.  The weather channel app- I used to really like this app but it has not kept up witht the competition. 
Every time I try to open it it loads way too slowly or not at all.  When I want to know the weather now I end
up just asking google as it is faster

5.  Dexcom G7 app- This is the app I use for my continuous glucose monitor as a newly diagnosed diabetic.
The app is very simple and quick to use.  It is consistent with relevant alerts and typically has no trouble connecting.
It has to run in the background all the time to keep in touch with my sensor but doesn't seem to be draining too
much battery.  One of the biggest frustrations with it however is that it does not show recorded data beyond 24 hours
in any detail.  For that you have to download a whole other app.
